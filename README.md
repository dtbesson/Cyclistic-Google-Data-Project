# Google Data Analytics Capstone Project : Cyclistic

## Introduction
This project is the final task for the Google Data Analytics course on Coursera. Throughout this project, I apply some of the skills I learnt on the course, as well as other skills I learnt along the way.

I use Python to process and clean the data and Tableau to visualise the data. Please note that although the course teaches RStudio over Python, I decided I want to work on my Python skills in this project. I elected not to use SQL this time, but hope to do so in future projects.

## The Scenario
In this fictional case study, I act as a junior data analyst in the marketing analytics team at a bike-sharing company called Cyclistic, based in Chicago. The director of the team believes that the future of the company's success lies within maximising the number of customers with annual memberships. It is my team's job to analyse how 'members' (those customers with annual memberships) and 'casuals' (one-time or daily pass users) use Cyclistic's bikes differently. From these insights, the team must design a new marketing strategy which will convert casual customers into annual members.

Cyclistic's services function as normal bike-sharing services do - users unlock a bike at one station, then lock the bike at another station at any time. Cyclistic also offers different kinds of bikes, including classic bikes, electric bikes and bikes designed for disabled customers.

## The Task
Three questions are posed to the marketing analytics team:
1. How do annual and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

The director of marketing has assigned me the first question: **How do annual and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?**


## The Data
Google has provided .csv files for both monthly and quarterly data from 2014 up to the present. This is an immense amount of data, so I decided to focus in on the monthly data for 2021 only. The data is collected internally by Cyclistic for the purposes of the marketing analytics team.

## Preparation and Cleaning
First, I open a few of these .csv files in Excel to get a general feel for the data. I notice that the data is generally quite clean.

The details of the data preparation and cleaning process are given in the attached Jupyter notebook. Please take a look!
